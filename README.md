# Blank files

A collection of minimal valid blank files in various formats for testing and development purposes. This is aimed at binary files, not text files.

## Categories

We're grouping things in broad strokes categories. These categories are still a bit fluid and might change.

- 3D
- 3D-editing
- audio
- audio-editing
- document-text
- document-spreadsheet
- document-presentation
- video
- video-editing
- CAD (Todo)
- etc. (Suggested and pull requests welcomed)
