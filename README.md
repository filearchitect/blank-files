# Blank files

A collection of minimal valid blank files in various formats for testing and development purposes. This is aimed at binary files, not text files.

## Categories

We're grouping things in broad strokes categories. These categories are still a bit fluid and might change.

- Design
- Document
- Image
- Spreadsheet
- Presentation
- Video
- Audio (Todo)
- 3D (Todo)
- CAD (Todo)
