# Blank files

A collection of minimal valid blank files in various formats. These files will be valid and open in the right software.

This collection focuses mainly on binary work files, not text-based files.

## Categories

We're grouping things in broad strokes categories. These categories are still a bit fluid and might change.

- 3D
- 3D-editing
- audio
- audio-editing
- document-text
- document-spreadsheet
- document-presentation
- video
- video-editing
- CAD (Todo)
- etc. (Suggested and pull requests welcomed)

## Contributing

There are a lot more file types that could be added here. If you'd like to add a new file type, please feel free to submit a Pull Request and add files to the `files` directory and update `files/index.json` file.

Keep your file as small and minimal as possible.
